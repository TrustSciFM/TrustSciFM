## Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just an auxiliary tool in scientific research—it is rapidly becoming a fundamental driver of discovery. Over the past decade, AI-related terms have surged across nearly every scientific discipline, signaling a profound shift in research methodologies. Among these advancements, **Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs)** have emerged as transformative instruments across biology, chemistry, physics, and medicine, offering unprecedented potential to accelerate breakthroughs.

However, their integration into science is not without critical risks. SciFMs suffer from alarming trustworthiness issues, including scientific hallucinations, biases, reproducibility failures, and opacity in decision-making. If left unaddressed, these challenges could severely undermine scientific integrity and stall AI-driven progress.

This workshop is the **first dedicated effort to tackle the trustworthiness crisis in SciFMs**, uniting experts from diverse scientific domains to confront these urgent concerns. Each discipline faces unique risks, yet a lack of cross-field communication has hindered collective solutions. This makes our workshop indispensable—by identifying common trust-related challenges across disciplines, we aim to catalyze discussions on reliability, evaluation frameworks, and accountability mechanisms essential for responsible SciFM development.

With NeurIPS as an ideal platform, this workshop will engage AI researchers and domain scientists in a critical discourse on both the promise and perils of SciFMs. We are convening leading pioneers to collaboratively define the necessary safeguards, shape ethical guidelines, and establish best practices—laying the foundation for SciFMs that are not only powerful but also scientifically reliable.

## Key Expected Outcome

A core deliverable of this workshop will be a **collaborative white paper**, serving as a definitive resource for guiding the future of SciFM research and development. This paper will synthesize insights, innovative methodologies, and policy recommendations derived from the event. Contributors will include invited speakers, organizers, and authors of high-impact accepted papers.

## Paper Submission

To foster interdisciplinary research on SciFMs, we invite authors from all disciplines (e.g., _ML, NLP, CV, Data Mining, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Social Sciences_). This workshop will explore both the _development of novel models_ and the _trustworthiness of existing ones_. The workshop includes three paper tracks: **Main Paper Track**, **Position Paper Track**, and **Demo Paper Track**.

### Topics of Interest

- **Model Innovation and Training:** Design of novel SciFM architectures, domain-adaptive pretraining techniques, and advancements in transfer learning for scientific models.
- **Evaluation and Validation:** Development of benchmarks, metrics, and reproducibility frameworks to ensure robust and consistent performance across diverse scientific domains.
- **Bias, Fairness, and Ethics:** Approaches to detect and mitigate dataset and model biases, address equity across disciplines, and ensure ethical and responsible use of SciFMs.
- **Explainability and Interpretability:** Tools and frameworks to improve model transparency, helping domain experts better understand predictions and decision-making processes.
- **Applications and Impact:** Demonstrations of SciFM applications in real-world scenarios across disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, social sciences) and analysis of their societal and scientific impacts.
- **Collaboration and Open Science:** Strategies to promote interdisciplinary research, democratize access to SciFMs, and enhance open-source sharing of models, datasets, and tools.

## Schedule and Virtual Attendance

**Workshop Format:** The workshop on Trustworthiness in Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs) will be a full-day event consisting of 3 keynote talks, 2 panel discussions, 3 oral sessions, and a poster session.

**Virtual Attendance:** The workshop will support virtual participation via live-streamed sessions and an interactive platform. Remote attendees can join Q&A, engage in panel discussions, and explore posters. Session recordings will be available post-event.

_Detailed schedule will be announced soon._
